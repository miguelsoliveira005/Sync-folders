# Folder Synchronization Script

This Python script performs one-way synchronization of files from a source folder to a replica folder. It can be scheduled to run periodically to ensure that the replica stays updated with the latest changes in the source.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine
- (Optional) Virtual environment for dependencies

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/folder-synchronization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd folder-synchronization
    ```

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Run the Script

Execute the script with the following command:

```bash
python sync_script.py /path/to/source_folder /path/to/replica_folder /path/to/sync_log.txt
```

Replace `/path/to/source_folder`, `/path/to/replica_folder`, and `/path/to/sync_log.txt` with the actual paths.

### Schedule Periodic Execution

To schedule the script to run periodically, you can use cron jobs on Linux/Mac or Task Scheduler on Windows. For example, to run the script every minute:

#### Linux/Mac

```bash
* * * * * /path/to/python /path/to/your/sync_script.py /path/to/source_folder /path/to/replica_folder /path/to/sync_log.txt
```

#### Windows

Use Task Scheduler to create a new task and set the trigger to run the script at your preferred interval.
